## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## to include an R code chunk defining a function with a single argument `data`

in this part, I just want to add a sentence
```{r}
day <- "It's a 'lovely' day"
day
```

and here I want to define a function with a single argument 'data'
```{r}
transform_data <- function(data) {
  transformed_data <- data[1:5, ]  # example transformation: subset the first five rows
  return(transformed_data)
}
transform_data
```
