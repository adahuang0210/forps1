## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## to include an R code chunk defining a function with a single argument `data`

in this part, I just want to add a sentence
```{r}
day <- "It's a 'lovely' day"
day
```

and here I want to define a function with a single argument 'data'
```{r}
transform_data <- function(data) {
  transformed_data <- data[1:5, ]  # example transformation: subset the first five rows
  return(transformed_data)
}
transform_data
```

## now i'm going to add second function that does a different transformation, but also takes a single argument `data` (a dataset) and returns a transformed dataset
in this part, i add this function. This function scales (normalizes) each numeric column in the dataset so that values range between 0 and 1.

```{r}
# Define a scaling function
scale_data <- function(data) {
  # Check for numeric columns and scale them
  data[sapply(data, is.numeric)] <- lapply(data[sapply(data, is.numeric)], function(x) (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))
  return(data)
}

# Test the function on a dataset like mtcars
scaled_mtcars <- scale_data(mtcars)
print(scaled_mtcars)
```
